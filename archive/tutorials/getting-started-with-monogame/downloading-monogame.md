# Downloading MonoGame
---
To download the MonoGame SDK, go to http://www.monogame.net/downloads/.  As of this writing, the current version is MonoGame 3.7.1.  If there is a newer version of MonoGame available, feel free to get that instead. However, keep in mind that everything in this tutorial is based on version 3.7.1.

Click the link for MonoGame 3.7.1, and you'll be taken to the release post with different options for the download.  You'll want to choose the **MonoGame 3.7.1 for Visual Studio** one.  Click this and start the download.

In the next section, we'll go over running the installer.
