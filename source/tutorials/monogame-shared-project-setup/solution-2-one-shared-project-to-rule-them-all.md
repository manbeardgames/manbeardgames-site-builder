# Solution 2: One (Shared) Project To Rule Them All
What if we could write all of our game code in one place and share this central code base to the platform specific project templates that we want to support? One (shared) project to rule them all.  Well, we can.  You may have noticed, but never used, the MonoGame Shared Project tempalte when creating a new project in Visual Studio.  This is the solution we'll be exploring in this tutorial.  We'll cover setting up the shared project, adding multiple platform projects to the solution, using one central Content Pipeline Tool for all projects, and building each individual project.
