            During part of this tutorial, we will use the MonoGame Android Project template to create a new android game project.  If you do not have the <b>Mobile Development with .NET</b> workload installed for Visual Studio, you will receive an error when attempting to create the project.  To add this workload to Visual Studio, you'll need to modify your Visual Studio installation to include this workload.
