# Installing MonoGame
---
Run the installer that we downloaded in the previous section to begin the installation process.  You'll be presented with a couple of screens to go through.  When you are presented with the choice of components to instlal, **be sure that the Visual Studio 2017** templetes are selected.  

Installing MonoGame doesn't install a seperate application on you computer that you'll use to develop the games.  Instead, what the installation is doing is installing project templates that we can use in Visual Studio to create the games using the MonoGame Framework, as well as some other libraries and tools that the MonoGame Framework relies on.

Once the installation completes, we can start making our first project. We'll cover this in the next section.
