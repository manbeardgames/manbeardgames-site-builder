# Installing Visual Studio
---
Once the download finishes, run the installer to begin installing Visual Studio.  It will ask you which components and workloads you want to install as part of the process.  Look over this list to see what's there, and if there is anything you thing you may have interest in, you can choose it now.  If you don't choose something now, you can always add it later by rerunning the installer which will allow you to modify your installation and choose additional workloads and components.  For now, the only thing we need at minimum is the **.NET Desktop Development** workload.  See the image below for reference on where this workload is on the list.

The installation may take a little while, Visual Studio has to download each of the components and install them. Once it finishes, move on to the next section and we'll start downloading and installing the MonoGame SDK.
