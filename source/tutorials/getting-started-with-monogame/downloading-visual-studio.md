# Downloading Visual Studio
---
The first thing we need to do is download and install Visual Studio.  Visual Studio is an integrated development environemnt, or IDE.  What this means is it's one application that we can use to write and develop, debug, and build our code.  As of the writing of this tutorial, the latest supported version is **Visual Studio 2017**.  The **Community Edition** is free and will work perfectly for what we need to do.  You can download Visual Studio at https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/

            As of this writting, Visual Studio 2019 has been released.  However, the MonoGame installation does not support this version.  This is why the download link given above is the /older-downloads/ page where you can find Visual Studio 2017.
